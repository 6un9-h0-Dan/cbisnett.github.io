Last fall we ran an experiment where we gave away a $99 Binary Ninja personal license to every student in our [Fuzzing For Vulnerabilities](http://theelectronjungle.com/ffv) course. The feedback was very positive and overall it made the code coverage exercise much easier to understand when the students were able to visualize the execution path.

After some discussions we've decided this is something we want to continue because it both supports a great project and gives students something they can continue to use and learn with even after the training ends. Our next public offering of Fuzzing For Vulnerabilities will be at [Blackhat USA 2017](https://www.blackhat.com/us-17/training/fuzzing-for-vulnerabilities.html) and we look forward to seeing everyone there.
