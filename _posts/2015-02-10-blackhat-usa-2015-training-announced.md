I'm excited to announce that a training course I've created called **Fuzzing For Vulnerabilities** has been selected for inclusion in the BlackHat 2015 in Las Vegas!  I've given this training previously at BlackHat Asia 2014 and BlackHat trainings in Washington DC but never before in Vegas.  [Registration](https://www.blackhat.com/us-15/training/fuzzing-for-vulnerabilities.html) open now and discounted until June 5th.  Also there are still spots open for the BlackHat Asia 2015 offering.

For now you can find the details of the class on the BlackHat training page.  In the future I'm going to write a longer blog post with more details about the training.
